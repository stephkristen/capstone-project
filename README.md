    What is MideoList?
    "Mideo" is a combination of "my" + "video" and has Filipino and Latin roots.

    For all movie and TV show fanatics! We knew many people,
    including ourselves who would utilize and appreciate a
    website like this.  With a similar function to the website, "MyAnimeList," our application eliminates having toremember which movies and TV shows you've already watched and allow you to view your personal rating on each one.

    And with the help of our Search functionality you can look
    up thousands of movies and TV shows and view trailers, which streaming service carries them and more! Just at the click of a button!

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get started, you'll need to install the packages listed in the Prerequisites section. At this time, if you want to change the API key, you'll have to hunt through the docs for where to do those replacements. See the Installations sections for more information.

### Prerequisites

* npm
  ```sh
  npm install react-router-dom
  ```
* npm
  ```sh
  npm install bootstrap
  ```
* npm
  ```sh
  npm install react-bootstrap
  ```
* npm
  ```sh
  npm install sass
  ```
* npm
  ```sh
  npm install youtube-react
  ```

### Installation

1. Get a free API Key at [https://rapidapi.com/movie-of-the-night-movie-of-the-night-default/api/streaming-availability/](https://rapidapi.com/movie-of-the-night-movie-of-the-night-default/api/streaming-availability/)
2. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/stephkristen/mideo-list.git
   ```
3. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
   <!-- Enter your API in `config.js` -->
4. At the moment, you'll have to search through the docs and insert your own API key. Currently, this is not in our config.js.
   ```js
   const API_KEY = 'ENTER YOUR API';
   ```
